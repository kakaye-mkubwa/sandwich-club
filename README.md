# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Designed a layout and populated data from locally stored JSON data without
using external libraries. This project has been done as a project under Udacity
Android Nano Degree

## How I have Completed this Project?
This starter code was downloaded from [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)
and consequentially designed the layout for the detail activity so that the different elements
display in a sensible way.
